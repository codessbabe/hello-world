# hello-world
bootcamp Praha pre-study
In 7 months from now (11 nov 2019 - 11 jun 2020) I will be a software engineer or full-stack web dev. 
Not only that but I will work at one of the FAANG companies (Google/ Facebook/ Apple/ WeWork). 
I will also probably move countries, maybe Germany/ Swizerland/ UK, preferably New York or Sillicon Valley.
